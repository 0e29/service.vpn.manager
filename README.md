VPN Manager for OpenVPN
=======================

This add-on is a service for Kodi that automatically switches between different VPN profiles/locations, allowing seemless navigation between geo locked services.  

It can connect to a VPN on Kodi startup (on OS boot for LibreELEC installs) and then maintain the VPN connection based on the add-ons being used.  The perceived location of the externally visable IP address is displayed upon connection.

A number of VPN providers are directly supported, or the user can add their own VPN profiles.

Control of the VPN is also possible via a remote control button or hot key, allowing the user to manually cycle between connections.
